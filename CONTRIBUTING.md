Feel free to contribute at any time! As a novice, I enjoy learning from others, and I'd like to keep this project afloat.
# Issues
Any issues go in the Issues tab. Make sure to *clearly state* what the problem is. Examples:
```
Good: I've gathered $150, purchased a coffee machine, and automated it. No money is being generated. I get this error repeatedly in my console: "blah blah error." Can someone help me?
Bad: My auto coffees aren't working! Fix it!
```
An error message will let people know where it's happening, but a single sentence complaint is very vague.
# Contributing
I'll be very glad to look at any and all pull requests made. A new feature might take a bit to be approved, since it has to be balanced. A style enhancement is welcome, but not as high on the priority list right now. The stage the game is in right now is mainly unstyled, but needs more features.
# Suggestions
Suggestions are always welcome because I can't churn out ideas all the time. Simply create an issue and tell everyone how it could be implemented, what it does, and how it could be balanced. Remember, even if I don't see your issue, someone else might, and make a pull request, which I will definitely see.
# Writing
Contributing doesn't mean just writing code just as the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide) declares. Writing a wiki can help newcomers. Don't be afraid to contribute.

Above all, follow the Contributor Covenant and keep a civil tongue. Think before you post something that could spark an argument.
