# Code of Conduct
I feel really silly for doing this, but I'd rather just make my own than follow a template.
The code of conduct is actually the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct), but there is one thing I have to change: I'm not comfortable with sharing my email, so please just send an issue my way. I know it feels too public, but it's the only way I can maintain privacy at this point.
Please look at the Contributor Covenant! It is really important, and breaking any of those rules can and *will* result in a report.
