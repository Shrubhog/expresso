Incremental game built entirely around coffee. Right now, it's just a work in progress. All it does is give you money right now. (Not real money. I meant it has a currency system.) I'd really like some help on other features, so pull requests are very much appreciated.

## What I'm planning
Technology tree goes like this:
* Scrounge for money in the couch, button disables itself after 10 dollars, gives one dollar
* Do a favor, no more money in the couch, appears after 10 dollars, disappears after 100, gives 10 dollars
* Get a coffee machine for 100 dollars, gives a coffee machine
* Make coffee for neighbors, gives 10 dollars
* Automate coffee machine for 50 dollars, gives one auto coffee machine (gives $1/second), costs one coffee machine
