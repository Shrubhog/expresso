Incremental game built entirely around coffee. It's pretty small. I'd really like some help on more features, so pull requests are very much appreciated.

## What I've done
Technology tree goes like this:
* Scrounge for money in the couch, button disables itself after 10 dollars, gives one dollar
* Do a favor, no more money in the couch, appears after 10 dollars, disables after 100, gives 10 dollars
* Get a coffee machine for 100 dollars, gives a coffee machine
* Make coffee for neighbors, gives 5 dollars
* Automate coffee machine for 50 dollars, gives one auto coffee machine (gives $5/second), costs one coffee machine
* Grandma's basement, because you need somewhere to set up shop, and your parents said no. $200
* Interns, which help around and just do stuff. Costs $50. $10/s
## Plans
I'm planning to switch from plain HTML, JS, and CSS to Angular and Typescript.
The main reason is because I've seen a lot of incremental games using Angular routes, which I think are pretty amazing.
But right now, I'm gonna stay in HTML, JS, and CSS cuz I want to add some more features:
* Croissant Makers give you $20/10s. Cost $75.
* Cookie Makers give you $35/10s. Cost $95.
* Maybe an upgrade tab, if I can figure out how to do it without exploding. It might have different flavors of croissants and cookies (yes, like in cookie-clicker)
